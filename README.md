# programming-algorithms-explained
Programming algorithms explained. With different programming languages: java, php, shell script, javascript, 
python and probably more

## How the Algorithms are Done ##

I will be listing programming problems here and may or maynot be fully solved. The main reason being, they are mostly 
supporting files for the blog https://gullele.com

Also, the solutions can be provided either in programming languages, pseudo code or without a solution at all.

## How to contribute ##

If you stumble upon this page and would like to contribute, I would be more that happy. Either you can have your comments on the
comment section, or you can fork the project and updated it.

The idea is to have the best algorithms entertained and to learn from each other. There are definitely so many ways to solve the 
problem, but a handful of algorithms that will be efficient.
